Associate Editor and Editorial Board comments
==============================
Both expert reviewers found merit in the work. However, they also raised issues concerning meaningful comparison with some of the existing methods and results. The authors must design and perform a meaningful comparison study, as suggested by both reviewers. Inadequately addressing the issues could lead to the rejection of the manuscript.

Comments to the Author
This paper is an useful paper which presents detection of non-Gaussianity in EEG signals using multivariate scale mixture model for diagnosis of epilepsy. The paper develop a new method for automated detection of epileptic seizures. But, this paper requires some more work before it is suitable for publication in IEEE TBME journal.

1. The paper should compare the obtained classification results with other existing methods in the literature. The following studied can be used for comparision:

(1) Seizures classification based on higher order statistics and deep neural network, Biomedical Signal Processing and Control, 2020.

(2) EEG-rhythm specific Taylor-Fourier filter bank implemented with O-splines for the detection of epilepsy using EEG signals, IEEE Sensors Journal, 2020.

(3) Classification of epileptic electroencephalogram signals using tunable-Q wavelet transform based filter-bank, Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing, 2020.

(4) A novel approach for time-frequency localization of scaling functions and design of three-band biorthogonal linear phase wavelet filter banks, Digital Signal Processing, vol. 69, pp. 309-322, October 2017..

(5) Three channel wavelet filter banks with minimal time frequency spread for classification of seizure-free and seizure EEG signals, In: D.S. Sisodia, R.B. Pachori, and L. Garg (Eds.) Handbook

Authors are requested to go through the literature and include some more papers for the comparision purpose.

2. The paper needs to include justification for the selection of number of filters in filter bank.

3. Please explain computational complexity of the proposed method.

4. What are the advantages and limitations of the proposed seizure identification method?

5. Please include some future directions of the presented research work.

6. Motivation for the presented study is not clear. Please explain.

Comments to the Author
The paper is interesting and well written. It addresses an important issue in the research area.

The following comments needs to be addressed before publishing.

1). It would be great if the authors compare with other existing techniques using their recorded EEG data, or test their methodology using a different set of EEG data.
2). The references are very old. The latest one is by 2016.
