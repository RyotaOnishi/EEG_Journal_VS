memo :
Feature extraction computation time was also evaluated. The computation time in Debug C++ code with Microsoft Visual Studio with Intel® CoreTM i7–6900K CPU @ 3.2GHz with 64GB RAM was calculated. The computation time was calculated for the sample length of 7500 for 5 frequency bands in parallel computing by changing the number of cores and it is shown in Figure ??.
